                            Bullying has been a big problem for a long time, and as society began to take it more seriously bullying adapted and changed, and new bullies have invented new methods to bully their victims.
                            Children's and teens' presence on the internet is now more than ever. The internet used to be a safe space for people to find individuals who share the same interests and create friendships. It served as a safe space for people who experience hardships in real life.
                            That safe space for many was broken into by bullying and hate, and suddenly sharing your opinions and interests might potentially lead to you being attacked bullied, and harassed.
                            That safe space ceased to exist. Which can be hard even for social extroverts. Just imagine your 2-3 hours on the internet spent replying to and dodging hate comments and messages.

                        <p>
                            Cyberbullying takes place on online platforms, it can occur via social media, messaging apps, direct texting, chat rooms, and online gaming communities. (What is cyberbullying?, n.d.)
                            Cyberbullying is a repetitive behavior about 30% of people who reported getting bullied online reported getting bullied more than once. (Hinduja J. W., 2019)
                            Cyberbullies aim to cause embarrassment and humiliation for their victims.
                            Cyberbullying includes activities like:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sending, posting, or sharing false, harmful, and negative content about someone.</li>
                            <li>Posting or sharing sensitive information of someone.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>A poll conducted by the UNICEF and the (SRSG) showed that 1/3 of the young people in 30 countries reported being a victim of online bullying. One-fifth reported skipping school due to cyberbullying. (UNICEF poll: More than a third of young people in 30 countries report being a victim of online bullying, 2019 )</li>	
                            <li>59% of teens in the US reported being bullied online (ANDERSON, 2018)</li>
                            <li>A study by McAfee found that 87% of teens observed cyberbullying (Birdsong, 2014)</li>

                        <p> Cyberbullying can have different effects on the victims than the “common form of bullying”. If you’re being bullied in school you always know that you can get back home where it’s safe where no one can harm you.
                            On the other hand, with online bullying, victims lose that safe space. You can feel that you’re being attacked in your own house in your room.
                            Cyberbullying affects its victims in different aspects of their lives, it affects kids’ mental health and their social life.
                            Children develop mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. 68%  of children currently having mental health problems reported experiencing cyberbullying in the last year. (How can you help, n.d.).
                            Of the students that reported cyberbullying:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>25% reported having an experience that led to a face-to-face confrontation with someone.</li>
                            <li>13% reported being anxious about having to go to school the next day </li>
                            <li>8% reported having a physical interaction with someone as a result of something that happened on social media.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p id="p2">
                            (Janine M. Zweig, 2013)
                            And these mental health problems can’t be taken as a joke. In some extreme cases cyberbullying victims have committed suicide. That was the case with a<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7035159/Teenage-girl-kills-posting-poll-social-media-asking-life.html">teenage girl who unfortunately took her own life</a>  after posting a poll asking if she should kill herself and 69% of her” friends” answered yes.
                            And <a href="https://www.cybersmile.org/news/13-year-old-pretoria-girl-kills-herself-after-being-cyberbullied">a 13-year-old child who had taken her own life </a> after being bullied by her schoolmates online.
                            All that points to the fact that it does have a major effect on children’s psyche and mental health.
