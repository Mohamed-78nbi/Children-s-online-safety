                            It’s no secret that the internet is growing and expanding rapidly, with that expansion more kids access the internet where estimates suggest that up to 90% of children and teens aged 12-18 have access to the internet (Mitchell, 2005).
                            And the average age of children’s first time accessing the internet being 9 years (Sonia & Haddon, 2011), and in many cases even smaller kids access the internet.
                            At this age children don’t have the awareness that enables them to deal with what the internet has to offer, data from Australia shows that 44% of children aged 9-16 reported encountering sexual images in the last month before the survey.

                            In a report by Bitdefender which is a internet security company they claim that 10% of the visitors to adult sites are under 10 years old!
                            The numbers may vary a little by different studies and different reports but they all point out to the same sad truth. Kids are watching porn.

                            At a young age pornographic material can have the effect of shaping a child’s sexual identity and behavior later on.
                            Effects of watching pornography on children:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promotes aggression and violence towards women </li>
                            <li>Can lead to addiction and obsession</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="p2">
                            “The aggression and violence towards women found in much of today’s popular pornography can teach boys and young men that it is socially acceptable, and even desirable, to behave aggressively towards and demean women.” (Baxter, 2014)
                            Pornography depicts violence as the norm, but how do people watch it and continue with their days?
                            Let’s talk about dopamine it’s a neurotransmitter which affects and shapes how we feel pleasure. It’s what makes the reward system in our brain making us strive for goals and feel satisfaction when we accomplish them, when a person consumes cocaine the drug increases the amount of dopamine in the brain in a fast manner. But as a person continues to consume the drug, he builds tolerance and his mind demands a larger amount of the drug to bring the satisfaction. 
                            And thus, all addiction becomes, and pornography works in the same way.
                            A kid might not enjoy what he’s seeing or doing but the compulsive need in his brain can’t stop nagging and asking for more, asking for a higher dosage with a higher concentration. (What is dopamine , n.d.)
                            Along the way a kid might develop an addiction in such a manner, where he looks at women from a dirty lens, sexual aggression and gender-stereotypical sexual beliefs will be developed.

                        <p>
                            So, how can you know If your kid is watching explicit content?  
                            First, we have to establish one thing, kids don’t report tehri online activity to tehri parents even when they experience something disturbing or unpleasant.
                            “
                            Only 13% of 9-16-year olds who were upset or bothered by an online risk used the reporting tools. 
                            “ (Livingstone, 2012)
                            “70% of teens hide online behavior from parents” (Sutter, 2012)

                            And I find the notion that “my kid would never do such thing” absurd a child is merely a child, and when adults fall for the same things how do you expects a child to have more awareness and maturity?
                            Here are the most common signs that a child is watching inline pornography:
                        </p>
                        <ol class="gradient-list">
                            <li>Using the internet a lot especially at night </li>
                            <li>Taking a device to the bathroom </li>
                            <li>Changing the screen quickly once you enter the room </li>
                            <li>Withdrawing from social activities</li>
                            <li>Putting a password that you don’t know on his/her device and becoming protective when it comes to the device</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <!--Border-->
                    <div class="section">
                        <h2><a id="5">How to deal with its occurrence </a></h2>
                        <p>
                            A typical expected reaction would be for a parent to lash out and take the device from their kid and make them feel guilt for their actions.
                            But that does no good, first thing lashing out about the problem would make your kids less likely to approach you with their serious problems and issues later in life out of fear of you and shame of disappointing you.
                            This should be taken as an opportunity to build bridges between you and your kid to strengthen the trust in your relationship. 
                            You must address the topic calmly, making your child more suspectable to listen and accept what you tell. Inform him of the effects it can have on him, and the potential dangers it holds. Make him feel comfortable to talk with you in such a topic so that he can feel that someone got his back. Draw some ground rules for him/her to follow and make sure that they understand that they’re there for their safety and well-being.

                                Filtering software like Qustodio helps you view how your child is using his device, apps and the web generally. It filters harmful content to protect your child, you can even set time limits for your child’s internet usage.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Delay handheld devices such as tablets, iPads and smartphones.
                                Let your children use a computer or a laptop that’s placed in a public room.
                            </li>

                                Safe search on google.
                                You can activate Safe search mode in your child’s Gmail account, which can filter explicit search results.
