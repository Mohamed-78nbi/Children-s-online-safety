                            The idea that we hold in our minds about an online predator, is that an online predator is an adult who exploits the naivety of juveniles and brain washes them into meeting when then he<sup>1</sup>  kidnaps the adolescent to assault him/her. But that stereotypical general image of online predators is far from reality thus it can be misleading and harmful to base our conversation and actions around it.
                            Most internet initiated-sex crimes that involves adults and minors, fit into the statutory rape (which is defined as a nonforcible sexual activity between an adult and a minor) model, where the offender seduces teenagers into doing sexual acts. 
                            I must point out to the fact that those minors aren’t forced into performing those acts. They maybe manipulated and pressured but most of them aren’t forced. That points out to a huge problem in their awareness and mindset. And that’s what must be targeted, their awareness.

                            “The statistics suggest that Internet-initiated sex crimes account for a salient, but small proportion of all statutory rape offenses and a relatively low number of the sexual offenses committed against minors overall. “ (Janis Wolak J. w., 2012) and also the University of New Hampshire's Youth Internet Safety Study (YISS) says that between 2000 and 2010 reports of unwanted sexual solicitations declined 53 percent.
                            In America in 2006 the percentage of arrests where violence had taken place was as low as 5%, abduction cases represented 2% of the arrests. 
                            So, what contributes to this great publicity you might be asking, Media attention, media unfortunately thrives on stories like this, whenever an arrest happens media outlets all jump on to cover the news, on the other end of the rope the reader unconsciously gets a false idea that pedophiles and offenders are 
                            While the chances are low, no parent would risk to take the chances.

                            The use of the pronoun “he” here is merely used to facilitate the writing of this research, though it must be mentioned that most of online predators are in fact males (Janis Wolak D. F., 2008)
