                            Phishing <br><br>
                            Phishing is the most common scam in which you get contacted via email, text messages, or telephone by someone impersonating a legitimate institution to get you to give him/her sensitive information regarding your bank account/ credit card/ passwords or identity.
                            They can pose as your bank or a governmental institution or any kind of organization really, the emails are designed deliberately to look genuine and authentic. 
                            Sometimes these emails might be sent to you from sb that you know whose account got hacked so that you’ll less willing to doubt its legitimacy.  
                            Scammers are usually very persistent urging you into giving your information in order to create a sense of urgency were you’re thinking is disrupted and not clear. Ignoring them is enough.

                            Shopping scams <br><br>
                            Usually, they are sites that offer high-end products for very low prices, don’t get fooled by the looks as these websites might look aesthetically pleasing and legitimate, they either send you fake copycats of what you ordered or you might get nothing at all. 
                            Best case scenario you’ll lose the money you paid; the worst case is that if you’ve entered your credit card data, they might use it to get money again.
                            How to spot them:
                            The products are advertised at an incredibly low price, the site will have only one option of payment which is credit or prepaid, they don’t have clear terms and conditions or refunding policies

                            Nigerian scams <br><br>
                            They’re the oldest trick in the book but shockingly people still fall for them.
                            The scammers pose as some type of a wealthy man whether it be a prince or a government official who needs help transferring his money, they create some type of story where he has some difficulties accessing the money or using it. The scammers ask for bank account details so that you can help “transfer the money” or they might ask for some kind of a series of upfront fees to help “release the money” all that while promising you a decent percentage of the money once the job gets done. Needless to say, you’ll never get any money and once you spot the trick and stop sending the money, they want they usually drain your bank account through the information you provided.

                            Bitcoin and cryptocurrency <br><br>
                            With the rise of cryptocurrencies throughout the past 10 years and how shiny and alluring they sound and their rising values everyone wants to invest in them, that’s when scammers appear luring people into buying fake cryptocurrencies or bitcoins from upcoming companies which are usually high risk or worthless if they exist at all.
                            The real danger here is if you provide your credit card or bank account data to any of those scammers.

                            Fine print scams <br><br>
                            These are probably the hardest ones to detect ever, in every site or app that you access there are ‘terms and conditions’ that we have to agree to, but nobody reads them as they’re usually very long.
                            Shady companies might put some conditions that violate your privacy or permit them to draw more money than what you signed up for. 
                            So, when you’re signing into a service that you never heard of before or just gives you an uneasy feeling make sure to read the terms and conditions before pressing the “I agree” button.

                            Malware short for” malicious software” generally is any type of software that is designed to harm your device, scammers use malwares to mine your device for personal data, bank and credit card info, they get access to your files and track your activity.
                            Malware might be delivered through pop up ads or emails, once you press the link the download start,
                            Some pop-up ads claim that your device has a virus and instructs you to download a software to download that will help “protect” your device.
                            Ransomware basically kidnaps your device locking you out and showing some kind of message demanding that you pay them in order to get your device back. There is no guarantee that you’ll get your device back.
                            In this case just take the device to a technician and they’ll know what to do.

                            The prizes can range from an electronic device to money from an international or an overseas lottery, they ask you to pay fees saying that it’s for governmental taxes or bank fees or insurance, and they continue stalling for a good period of time till they get enough money from you.
                            Some even use real lotteries names so that if you’ve done superficial research you might stop doubting.

                            Scammers rise during a crisis whenever a catastrophe happens somewhere in the world scammers take advantage of that and use your compassion and generosity to their benefit, creating fake charities to take your money, thus not only affecting you by stealing your money but also diverting the donations needed by the real legitimate charities.
                            If you donate at any given time stick to reputable charities and usually the authorities publish lists of approved charities so check that out first.

                            Free stuff scams<br><br>
	                        Who doesn’t like free stuff, something like a pen a mug, or any small thing like that are usually very low on price that’s why they can be free. But when you get an advertisement claiming that you won an iPhone or a tv for free that’s a big lie, don’t give them your information. Because we all know there’s no reason for sb to handout free expensive stuff for free.
