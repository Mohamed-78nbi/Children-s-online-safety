                        <p>
                            When we think about violent or extreme groups and individuals, we often tend to picture them as stupid, ill minded barbarians or closed silent people who are completely disconnected from technology, though they might be ill minded in their decisions and actions they’re far from being disconnected and throughout the years we observed a rise of the online presence of extremist ideologies, individuals and groups.
                            Violent groups and individuals began to use technology to plan and design their attacks, they even streamed their attacks (New Zealand’s terrorist attack) and uploaded (public executions performed by ISIS) it to the whole world via platforms that is used daily by millions like Facebook and YouTube. (BBC, 2019)
                            Their use of technology and social media hasn’t been limited only to scare intimidate and boast about their monstrosities and sick ideas. They utilized those platforms to serve as stages where they can share and spread their ideas and tenets with potential millions as audience. And with a massive audience they target a few of a few to fill their minds with their believes to get their support and in extreme cases recruit new individuals into their twisted believes.

                            They tend to target vulnerable individuals that have a sense of lostness, who doesn’t share an identity with a group, who doesn’t feel like they belong anywhere. The targeted age groups are the youth, the younger the mind the easier it is to control. Social media is used as a tool to indoctrinate those minds into taking extreme social, political or religious stands.
                            And there are various examples of the usage of media to perpetuate such believes by such groups and individuals, you can right now get on the website of “the church of scientology” which is basically a cult, were suspicious activities run, and had lots of former members and executives share stories about the torture and abuse that occurs there, some even accuse them of human trafficking. They used the media and celebrities like Tome Cruise to trickle into more minds. Right now, they have a twitter account and a tv network of their own.  (Yahr, 2016) (Johnson, 2019)
                            There are even accounts of KKK members, like David Duke who was a former grand wizard at the KKK, who frequently posted on twitter for a long time before he got permanently suspended in July of 2020. (Gardner, 2018) (BBC, 2020)
                            (Marsh, 2001)

                        <h2>
                            <a id="2">Slow rate radicalization: how the internet is killing conversation and radicalizing individuals everyday</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            What I think pose as a closer and more probable problem is the slow radicalization that is happening everyday throughout social media especially. It’s the destruction of the basis of conversation, with the delivery of one’s opinions as facts, demonizing or belittling every opposer and in the process killing the idea of a conversation.
                            The internet is now a public court, where individuals can judge people and categorize them sticking lots of labels on them through the way. With sentences being given condemning people to hell and heaven, giving praise and destroying lives. (Mohammed, 2018) (SPITZNAGEL, 2019)
                            And we see the repercussions of this in real life as violence increases in a slow but steady rate in the normal social interactions especially between kids , as they are only mimicking what they perceive is the acceptable behavior that’s presented to them through the internet.
                            We should aspire to have more accepting and humble individuals that value the difference of opinion, not try to abolish it. We must be willing to accept opinions that defy ours, leaving the way for civil discourse to take its place, not affected nor interrupted by individual’s Egos.
                            Without experiencing the consequences of our actions on the internet we grow freer and more reckless in our deminer of speech. Because well no matter how disrespectful or mean you’re on the internet if you’re not a public figure most likely you won’t face any consequence. (Scheff, 2018)
                            While in the real world you could never curse a stranger in the face, on the internet it’s very easy. 
                            We can see hundreds of videos of people reacting to mean disrespectful comments, from cursing to death threats the insults vary.

                            Those teachings and principles are not an ideal environment for children to learn and acquire traits and values, especially in a young age were they’re personality is being shaped and structured.
